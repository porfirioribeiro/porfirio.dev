    Hello there! My name is Porfírio, i am a self taught software developer from
    Portugal
  </p>
  <p>
    Shifted career from Farming to Development 5 years ago to follow my dream,
    becoming a software developer. Today i am the head of development and manage
    a team of 3 people.
  </p>
  <p>
    Started as a frontend developer with JavaScript, SASS and React, but later
    also got into backend development with Java/Kotlin and Spring framework.
    Becoming more full stack developer. Also did the mobile app of the company
    with Dart and Flutter.
